Topic: {topic}

Please create:
1. A title for the passage (5-8 words)

The passage should be:
- Informative and engaging
- Similar to CELPIP reading test format
- Appropriate for English language learners
- Well-structured with clear paragraphs

Each question should be in fill-in-the-blank format:
- Have questionParts with "before" and "after" text around the blank
- Test comprehension, inference, or vocabulary
- Have one clearly correct answer
- Include 4 plausible options
- Be numbered 1-5

The response section should:
- Be a response to the original email/passage
- Have 3-5 fill-in-the-blank questions
- Use placeholders like number in curly braces in the content
- Include realistic options for each blank

We actually thought about getting you a beautiful sofa for your new apartment, but I guess that won't fit through your narrow stairway. Do you think you have enough warm clothes for the upcoming winter? Does he have everything you need for the colder months - perhaps some cozy sweaters or a warm coat?\n\nI remember last year's celebration was absolutely fantastic, and I know this one will be even better. We're bringing some homemade cookies and party games that everyone will enjoy.\n\nLet me know if there's anything specific you'd like us to bring, and we'll see you on Saturday!\n\nLove,\nMea",
